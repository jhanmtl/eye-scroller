caveats:

1. add "mainFields: ['main']" to node_modules/react-script/config/webpack.config.js to make React compatible with current tfjs. see https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/issues/3384#issuecomment-643317776
2. kinda of a roundabout solution of hosting the actual model.json: push first to the repo in the maaster branch and then use the 'raw' link in the tf.loadLayersModel call in App.js
